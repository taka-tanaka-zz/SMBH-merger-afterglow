The Mathematica Notebook calculates and plots the spectral energy distribution of a torus of gas around a recently merged supermassive black hole binary.

Such a system was predicted to produce an X-ray “afterglow” several years after the merger of the binary produces gravitational waves. Such a smoking gun signal would be of great importance for the theory of accretion disks onto supermassive black holes and the associated “active galactic nucleus” phenomenon.

The model, described in Tanaka & Menou (2010, Astrophysical Journal), is a time-dependent extension of the qualitative picture described by Milosvljevic & Phinny (2005). The model parameters, which the user can modify at the top of the notebook, are described in the tables of those papers.
